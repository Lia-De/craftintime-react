## New Figma prototype for Craft in Time
[Figma To Do v5](https://www.figma.com/proto/CZhjlhFft9ezpkyJNBcyUX/Crafting-To-Do?node-id=60-821&t=eeJg3f9Wd046Ypaz-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=59%3A141&starting-point-node-id=60%3A821)
--------------------------------------------------
## Next version Going forward (5 Feb, 2025) - Version 0.5
Adding timers for tasks, reworking deadline, and working on adding the possible features:
- [ ] Login for users
- [x] Ability to start timer on the each task
      - Timers can get assigned to a task when you stop them. Not at creation
- [ ] Sorting projects by: Name, Status, Hours Worked, Tag
    - [x] Sort by status
- [x] Keeping time per Task as well as for whole Project
- [x] Keep a history of DateTime stamps for each time you worked on a Task
- [ ] Manually add time spent
- [ ] Fields for - [x] StartDate and - [ ] CompleteDate For total time of project.
   - Maybe a list of all changes of status { Status, DateTime } to keep track of that.

## Design Considerations going forward (29/1 2024) - [Version 0.4](https://github.com/Lia-De/ToDoList/tree/ToDo_v4)
This will be an app to keep track of time and processes for craft projects. Textile, wood, or whatever else needs a user to keep track of their time.

Often when I make a textile item I get asked: "How long did that take you to make?" and I rarely know, because who has time to write down times for all
the things you do for a project. I might be wanting to sell the results of my work, but I don't know what to charge, because I don't know how much time
it took.

### Required features for Version 0.4
- [x] Adding Projects, with title, some description and a way to add Tags and Tasks.
- [x] Projects should total the time spent on them.
- [x] Projects should have status: Planning, active, paused or completed.
- [X] Tags should be universal, available to be applied to any and all projects and sub-tasks.
- [X] Tasks must belong to a project.
- [x] Tasks should have a title and possibly description, status and possibly a deadline and tags.
- [x] Users should be able to track time per Project.
- [x] Front end should be a website done with responsive designed mobile-first.
   - [x] Create projects, add tasks and tags
   - [x] List all Projects
     - [X] Name, Description, Status, TimeSpent, Tasks and Tags
     - [X] For Tasks: Name, Description, Status, Deadline, (TimeSpent)
     - [X] For Tags: Name
   - [X] List all Tags (show names and usages in Projects/Tasks)
   - [X] Add Tags to Tasks
   - [x] Start and stop Timers for Projects
   - [x] Edit fields for Project:

      - [x] Status
